# Figma to Code Project Rules

## Core Principles
- Follow a modular component architecture
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Follow iOS design guidelines for mobile UI components

## Workflow Guidelines (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Always check PLANNING.md and TASKS.md before starting work
- Confirm with the user before starting a new task
- Test each step thoroughly before marking it complete
- Update TASKS.md after completing each step
  - Not yet completed tasks remain as "[ ]"
  - Mark tasks as "âœ…" when completed
  - Mark tasks as "[IN PROGRESS]" when actively working on them
- Never begin a new task without user approval

## Research Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- If less than 85% certain about an implementation, MUST use perplexity MCP to search for documentation
- MUST use sequential thinking MCP to create step-by-step implementation plans for complex features
- Document research findings and implementation decisions

## AI Integration
- Use OpenRouter API with Claude 3.7 Sonnet model
- API Key: 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
